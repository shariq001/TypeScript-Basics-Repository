In TypeScript, const and let are two keywords used to declare variables, each with distinct characteristics and use cases. These keywords were introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and are also available in JavaScript.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- let

-- Scope: The let keyword declares a variable that is block-scoped, meaning it is limited to the block (enclosed by {}) in which it is defined. This makes let more predictable and reduces the chances of unintended variable access or modification compared to var, which is function-scoped.
-- Reassignment: Variables declared with let can be reassigned new values.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- const

-- Scope: The const keyword also declares a variable that is block-scoped, similar to let.
-- Reassignment: Variables declared with const cannot be reassigned. They must be initialized at the time of declaration and the reference to the value cannot change. However, if the value is an object or an array, the contents of the object or array can still be modified.

- Differences Between let and const

--Reassignment:

--- let: Variables can be reassigned.
--- const: Variables cannot be reassigned once initialized.

-- Initialization:

--- let: Variables can be declared without initialization.
--- const: Variables must be initialized at the time of declaration.

-- Use Cases:

--- let: Use let when the variable's value is expected to change.
--- const: Use const when the variable's value should remain constant after initialization.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Best Practices

-- Prefer const over let: By default, use const unless you know that the variable's value will change. This makes the code easier to understand and reduces the risk of accidental reassignment.

-- Block Scoping: Both let and const are block-scoped, which helps prevent issues with variable scope and makes the code more predictable. Use block-scoped variables to limit the scope as much as possible.

-- Immutability: Favor immutability by using const for variables that should not be reassigned. This practice can lead to more reliable and maintainable code.
