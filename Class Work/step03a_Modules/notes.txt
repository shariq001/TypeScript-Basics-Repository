Modules in TypeScript are a way to organize and encapsulate code into reusable, maintainable units. They allow developers to break down a large codebase into smaller, more manageable pieces, each with its own functionality. This modular approach makes code easier to understand, test, and maintain. TypeScript modules are based on the ES6 module system and are fully compatible with JavaScript modules.

- Key Concepts of TypeScript Modules
-- Exporting: Modules can export classes, interfaces, functions, variables, etc., making them available to be imported by other modules.

-- Importing: Modules can import exported members from other modules to use them.

-- Namespaces: Used to organize code within a module, primarily for older codebases and legacy support. They are different from modules and are generally not recommended for new code.

- Exporting in TypeScript
You can export members of a module using the export keyword. There are two primary ways to export: named exports and default exports.

-- Key Differences between Export and Export Default

-- Number of Exports:

--- export: Allows multiple named exports from a module.
--- export default: Allows only one default export per module.

- Importing in TypeScript
You can import exported members into another module using the import keyword. There are different ways to import depending on how the members were exported.

-- Import Syntax:

--- export: Named exports must be imported using curly braces and their exact names (or aliases).
--- export default: Default exports are imported without curly braces and can be assigned any name.
