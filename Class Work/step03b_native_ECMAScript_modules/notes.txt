Native ECMAScript Modules (ES Modules or ESM) are a standardized module system introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6). TypeScript fully supports ES Modules, which provide a robust way to organize and encapsulate code into reusable units. ES Modules allow developers to create modular applications, where each module can export and import specific functionalities.

- Key Features of ECMAScript Modules

-- Syntax:

--- Exporting: Use export and export default to expose parts of a module.
--- Importing: Use import to bring in functionalities from other modules.
--- Scope: Modules have their own scope, meaning variables, functions, and classes defined in a module are not visible outside unless explicitly exported.
--- Loading: Modules are loaded asynchronously, and dependencies are resolved before execution, promoting better performance and avoiding the "callback hell" of older module systems like CommonJS.

--- Browser Support: Modern browsers support ES Modules natively, allowing for direct use in web applications without bundlers like Webpack, though bundlers are often used for optimization and compatibility reasons.

- Advantages of Using ECMAScript Modules

-- Standardization: ES Modules are part of the ECMAScript standard, ensuring consistency and interoperability across different environments and tools.
-- Scoping: Modules have their own scope, preventing variable and function conflicts.
-- Async Loading: ES Modules are loaded asynchronously, which can improve application performance.
-- Tree Shaking: Bundlers can perform tree shaking to eliminate unused code, reducing the final bundle size.
