Intersection types in TypeScript allow you to combine multiple types into a single type that has all the properties of the combined types. This is useful when you want to create a new type that merges the characteristics of several existing types.

- Use Cases
-- Combining Multiple Types: When you need an object to adhere to multiple types or interfaces.
-- Augmenting Types: When adding properties to existing types or creating composite types from several sources.
-- Merging Class Types: When working with class hierarchies and you need an object that satisfies multiple classes.

- Summary
Intersection types in TypeScript use the & operator to combine multiple types into a single type that has all the properties of the combined types. This is useful for creating composite types from various sources, combining properties, and augmenting existing types or interfaces.
