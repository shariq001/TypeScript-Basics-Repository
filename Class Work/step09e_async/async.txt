In TypeScript (and JavaScript), async is a keyword used to define an asynchronous function. An asynchronous function is a function that returns a Promise and allows you to write code that performs asynchronous operations in a more readable and manageable way, often referred to as "synchronous-looking" code.

- Key Concepts:

-- async Keyword:

When you declare a function with the async keyword, the function will automatically return a Promise, even if you don't explicitly return a Promise object.
await Keyword:

Inside an async function, you can use the await keyword to pause the execution of the function until a Promise is resolved or rejected. This allows you to write asynchronous code that looks more like synchronous code, making it easier to read and manage.

- Benefits of async/await:

-- Improved readability: Makes asynchronous code easier to read and write compared to using Promise chaining with .then() and .catch().
-- Error handling: Allows you to use try...catch for error handling, which can be more intuitive than dealing with promise rejections.

Compatibility:
async/await is supported in TypeScript, which compiles down to JavaScript that is compatible with environments that support ES2017 (ES8) or later.
This makes handling asynchronous operations, like fetching data from an API or reading files, much more manageable.
